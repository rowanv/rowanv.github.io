			<h2>Don't Get Kicked Dataset</h2>
				This dataset was used for the "Don't Get Kicked" competition on Kaggle. The objective of the competition was to predict which cars would be bad buys or "kicks". The training data set consisted of 72983 and 34 variables. The data set is freely available and can be downloaded through Kaggle.
				<h3>Data Exploration and Cleaning</h3>
				I cleaned and the data set and created some preliminary plots of a variety of variables. Several of the cost density curves appeared to be bimodal. I've included a few of the density curves and histograms that might be of interest.<br>

				<h3>Logit Model</h3>
				<h3>Random Forests Model</h3>
				
			<h2>Research Awards Dataset</h2>
				This is a Research Spending and Results dataset that provides information on 				federally funded research (specifically NSF and NASA awards) for the year 2013. The 				data set has over 13,000 observations, and is publicly available on research.gov . 
				<h3>Descriptive Statistics</h3>
					<p>I initially produced a histogram and boxplot of Research Award Amounts to 					examine the spread of the amounts. Due to a number of outliers that skewed the 						data sets, the initial plots were not very useful. I removed these outliers 					and produced the following histogram and box plot:</p>

				<h3>Tableau Visualization</h3>
			<h2>Cars Dataset</h2>
				This dataset gives the speed of cars and the corresponding distance taken to stop. The data set has 50 observations, and is available within the datasets package in R.
				<h3>Linear Regression</h3>
					I fitted the data to a linear model. The linear model yields the equation Y = 3.9324X - 17.5791. For each additional unitary increase in speed, measured in mph, the model predicts an increase of 3.9324 feet before the car will stop. The results are highly statistically significant, with a p value < 0.001.
